from Startup run "Git shell" :
> git init 
Copy all the source code into the Github directory above using normal copy and paste. At the GitHub folder run the following command:
> git add *
> git commit -m "first commit"
Only Run this remove command  at the 1st time – for initialise the new project: 
> git remote add origin https://github.com/millsph/millsph.github.io
> git commit -m "first commit"
That will setup the account to GitHub sit. 
And git push doing the copy the webpages to the designated website : 
> git push -u origin master.
